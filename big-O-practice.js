// 1. What is the Big O for this?
//     1) Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 people. You want to find a playmate for your dog, preferably of the same breed. So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. You stand up and yell out, who here has a golden retriever and would like to be a playdate for my golden. Someone yells - "I do, be happy to bring him over"
            // Constant time O(1)
//     2) Determine the Big O for the following algorithm: You are sitting in a room with 15 people. You want to find a playmate for your dog who is of the same breed. So you want to know if anyone out of the 15 people have the same breed as your dog. You start with the first person and ask him if he has a golden retriever. He says no, then you ask the next person, and the next, and the next until you find someone who has a golden or there is no one else to ask.
            // Linear time O(n)    
            
            
// 2. Even or odd
// What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function isEven(value) {
    if (value % 2 === 0) {
        return true;
    }
    else {
        return false;
    }
}

//Constant time O(1) because we are only assessing one value with one equation

// 3. Are you here?
// What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function areYouHere(arr1, arr2) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
        const el1 = arr1[i];
        for (let j = 0; j < arr2.length; j++) {
            const el2 = arr2[j];
            if (el1 === el2) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
//Polynomial time O(n^2) because it requires two levels of looping

// 4. Doubler
// What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function doubleArrayValues(array) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        array[i] *= 2;
    }
    return array;
}
//Linear time O(n) because it iterates through the whole array length and performs one task

// 5. Naive search
// What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function naiveSearch(array, item) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        if (array[i] === item) {
            return i;
        }
    }
}
//Linear time O(n) because it is iterating through the array until it finds a matching item

// 6. Creating pairs:
// What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function createPairs(arr) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for(let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
            console.log(arr[i] + ", " +  arr[j] );
        }
    }
}
//Polynomial time O(n^2) because it requires two levels of looping

// 7. Compute the sequence
// What does the following algorithm do? What is its runtime complexity? Explain your answer

function compute(num) {
    let result = [];
    for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {

        if (i === 1) {
            result.push(0);
        }
        else if (i === 2) {
            result.push(1);
        }
        else {
            result.push(result[i - 2] + result[i - 3]);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

//Linear O(n)- the function is creating a result array by adding numbers to the array based on the index (fibonacci sequence)

// 8. An efficient search
// In this example, we return to the problem of searching using a more sophisticated approach than in naive search, above. Assume that the input array is always sorted. What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function efficientSearch(array, item) {
    let minIndex = 0;
    let maxIndex = array.length - 1;
    let currentIndex;
    let currentElement;

    while (minIndex <= maxIndex) {
        currentIndex = Math.floor((minIndex + maxIndex) / 2);
        currentElement = array[currentIndex];

        if (currentElement < item) {
            minIndex = currentIndex + 1;
        }
        else if (currentElement > item) {
            maxIndex = currentIndex - 1;
        }
        else {
            return currentIndex;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

//Logarithmic time O(log(n))- the function cuts the problem size in half each round through

// 9. Random element
// What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function findRandomElement(arr) {
    return arr[Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length)];
}

//Constant time O(1)- the function is performingly only one task and the arr length does not affect the runtime

// 10. What Am I?
// What does the following algorithm do? What is the Big O of the following algorithm? Explain your answer

function isWhat(n) {
    if (n < 2 || n % 1 !== 0) {
        return false;
    }
    for (let i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
        if (n % i === 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
//Linear O(n)- checking to see if n is a prime number, only one loop
